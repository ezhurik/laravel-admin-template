Stop wasting time setting up basic things in laravel for admin panels

For the guys who are wasting out time there setting up admin templates every time when a new project comes up, 
here I present you a basic template which you just have to download it and tweak it as you wish.

I have used Admin LTE template is a popular open source WebApp template for admin dashboards.

This project provide the following features <br>
-> login <br>
-> Admin profile <br>
	-> admin details are prefilled in the admin form <br>
	-> can edit the deatils with profile pic too <br>
	-> jquery validations applied <br>
-> Customer module <br>
	-> listing customers with search, pagination and sorting <br>
	-> add, update and delete customers along with laravel validations <br>

So whenever you wanna setup a fresh laravel project just download it, setup the database and you are ready to work with the main logic.
Hope it will help laravel developers to some extend.

Any suggestions to improve code is highly appreciable.
